								<h3>
Deep Tissue Massage Explained</h3><p>Deep tissue massage is a specific type of massage that works on the deep layers of muscle and fascia in the body. Deep tissue works all of your connective tissue and fascia, as opposed to Swedish massage, which is more superficial. It is beneficial for chronically tense and contracted areas such as stiff necks, low back tightness, and sore shoulders.
The Pressure is deeper and concentrated on areas of tension and pain releasing troublesome areas.&nbsp; <a href="prices.html" class="link1">Back to Price Page</a></p><br><h3>The Technical Part </h3><p>When chronic muscle tension or injury exists, there are usually adhesions (bands of painful, rigid tissue) in muscles, tendons, and ligaments.

Adhesions can block circulation and cause pain, limited movement, and inflammation.

With no blood getting to heal these adhesions, they will grow and shorten the functioning part of the muscle, forcing the undamaged part to stretch to compensate, hence, weakening the muscle.
Deep tissue massage works by physically breaking down these adhesions to relieve pain and restore normal movement. To do this, the massage therapist often uses direct deep pressure (trigger point therapy) or friction applied across the grain of the muscles.

Scar tissue, can also weaken the muscle. The scar tissue forms as a raised lump on the healed area, without friction to break down the excess scar tissue, there is more chance of the muscle re-damaging/tearing. Once the scar tissue has been broken down level to the muscle, this strengthens the once damaged fibre and ensuring less chance of it re-tearing.&nbsp;<a href="prices.html" class="link1">Back to Price Page</a></p><br><h3>Benefits of Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
	
<h2 style="color:#069">Potential Benefits</h2>
<p>Deep tissue massage usually focuses on a specific problem, such as chronic muscle pain, injury rehabilitation, and the following conditions:</p>

			                </ul></p>
                                        <p>Deep tissue massage also received a top ranking for fibromyalgia pain. People often notice an improved range of motion immediately after a deep tissue massage.<br>.&nbsp;<a href="services.html" class="link1">Back to Price Page</a></p></div><br><h3>What to Expect</h3><p>While some of the strokes may feel the same as those used in Swedish massage therapy, deep tissue massage isn't a stronger version of a Swedish massage.</p><br><h4 style="color:#069">Deep tissue massage techniques are used to break up scar tissue and physically break down muscle "knots" or adhesions (bands of painful, rigid tissue) that can disrupt circulation and cause pain, limited range of motion, and inflammation.</h4><br><p>At the beginning of a deep tissue massage, lighter pressure is generally applied to warm up and prepare the muscles. Specific techniques are then applied. Common techniques include:</p>
                                         <div class="sidebar-nav">
                                        <ul><li><a href="services.html">Stripping: Deep, gliding pressure along the length of the muscle fibers using the elbow, forearm, knuckles, and thumbs.</a></li>
                                            <li><a href="services.html">Friction: Pressure applied across the grain of a muscle to release adhesions and realign tissue fibers.</a></li>
                                          </ul></p><p>

Massage therapists may use fingertips, knuckles, hands, elbows, and forearms during a deep tissue massage. You may be asked to breathe deeply as the massage therapist works on tense areas.

</p><p>After the massage, you may feel some stiffness or soreness, but it should subside within a day or so. Be sure to contact your massage therapist if you have concerns or if you feel pain after having a massage.</p><p>

Drinking water after the massage may help to flush the metabolic waste from the tissues.<br>.<a href="prices.html" class="link1">Back to Price Page</a>
</p><h3>
Does Deep Tissue Massage Hurt</h3><p>You may experience some discomfort during your treatment especially if you have some large chronic knots. That's to be expected when the pressure is deep and direct on painful or injured areas. Scar tissue is being loosed and muscles lengthened, knots are being undone and sub-layers of muscle moved back into the right place. Taking a deep breath when especially tense areas are tackled can be helpful. Let your therapist know if you feel pain and you want them to reduce the pressure. It is important to communicate to your therapist about specific areas of tension and intensities of pressure. The same pressure doesn't apply to every area and each person has different tolerance levels. Talk about positioning before and during the treatment so your therapist can work around what is most comfortable.&nbsp;<a href="prices.html" class="link1">Back to Price Page</a></p>
