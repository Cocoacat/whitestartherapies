If 24 hours is not given, the client will be responsible to pay a 50% charge of the scheduled appointment. If the booked appointment is missed with no contact a 100% charge will be applied. <br><br>Please be aware that when booking an appointment on the same day, it is considered set, and if changed, cancelled or rescheduled at any point after it is made, the client is responsible for paying for the full price of the appointment.<br><br>Cancellation fees are in effect to ensure that our therapists are compensated for their time. Please keep in mind that if inadequate notice is given it is extremely difficult to fill vacant spots, this not only negatively impacts our therapists who only get paid when they deliver a treatment, but also affects our clients. Please be courteous to your therapist and other clients by respecting our policies.

Johanna gives excellent work and she takes her time to REALLY work out the troubled areas. I am really impressed with her knowledge of the body and postural issues.

She is very thorough on what she does and in asking if there is any area in particular bothering you so she can concentrate on that area for you...In my opinion, you won't regret going to Johanna for a massage. </blockquote>

A friend recommended Jo for Indian Head Massage so I thought I'd try it so I booked a treatment. I am so glad I did, after 6 treatments I can now say that the pain and headaches have gone, and I now have regular treatments to keep my headaches from returning. Thanks Jo. </blockquote>
