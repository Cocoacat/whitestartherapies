								<h3>
What is Tui-Na?</h3><p> Tui Na (pronounced  '&nbsp;twee-nah&nbsp;'&nbsp; ) massage is a complete healing system, like acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. These three forms of therapy are the main components of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).
Tui Na is applied to your clothed body. Patients sit on a chair or lie on a couch. In China, Tui Na therapists treat conditions that, in the West, would be treated by osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists or with drugs </p><br><p>Because Tui Na, along with acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, are the main components of Traditional Chinese Medicine. As such, Tui Na can be used to treat specific areas, or it can be used to improve the overall Qi or energy flow throughout the body. Because Tui Na is a complete system, the treatment often helps both these components at the same time. Tui Na is thought to be the oldest system of bodywork practiced today.</p><br><p>Tui Na can be used as an integrative treatment with traditional medicine. In addition, it can be used with other forms of alternative medicine, including Shiatsu massage, sports massage, deep-tissue neuromuscular bodywork, and myofacial release.</p><a href="prices.html" class="link1">Back to Price Page</a></p><br><h3>What Is the Aim Of Tui Na?</h3><p>The aim of Tuina is to apply movement and pressure to facilitate the flow of qi through the meridian channels and to regulate this with deep stimulation of relevant qi-points. Tuina is not acupressure. The latter is exactly what it says it is, namely deep, static pressure applied to qi-points. Tuina on the other hand, offers the practitioner a diverse range of techniques that are designed to focus pressure with movement both along the meridians and into the qi-points. The subtle variety of direction and force that can be brought to bear on each point is one of the unique features of this massage.</p><br><p>For Tuina to be successful in facilitating qi flow and releasing blockages in this vital energy, the tissues themselves must be amenable to the diffusion of qi. The soft tissue techniques achieve this by loosening the muscle fasciae (connective tissue sheaths enclosing muscle), stimulating lymph flow and blood circulation and affecting tendon organs (tension sensitive sense organs in tendons) so as to improve muscle relaxation.
</p><br><p>Every qi-point has an effect on qi movement when it is intensely stimulated with pressure or a needle as in acupuncture. An expert Tuina practitioner will know what combination of these points to use when treating specific problems such as frozen shoulders, sciatica, nausea etc.</p><br><p>Whilst it is true to say that most qi-points can be used to treat problems in their immediate vicinity, many have powerful effects in quite distant parts of the body. For example, qi-point pericardium 6 on the under side of the forearm just up from the wrist has a powerful calming effect and stops vomiting. Qi-point large intestine 4 between first and second metacarpels treats headaches and sinus problems and bladder 60 behind the outer ankle bone (maleolus) treats lower back pain. This means Tuina can treat problems in places where the therapist's hands cannot reach.</p>

<h2 style="color:#069">Potential Benifits</h2>
<p>One of the wonderful things about tui na is that it relaxes the body while also being energizing.</p><br><p> During a tui na massage session the practitioner is able to focus on the specific problem that the patient is dealing with at that time. Focusing as it does on specific meridians and acupoints, Tuina is able to treat all those conditions and injuries that in the West would be treated by osteopathy, chiropractic and physiotherapy plus a lot of others that would be treated with drug therapies.</p><br><p> It excels in the treatment of chronic pain associated with the musculo-skeletal system such as neck and shoulder pain, fibrositis, lumbago, sciatica, muscle spasms, tennis and golfer's elbow, and frozen shoulder. As a means of treating sports injuries, it is unsurpassed. To this long list can be added chronic problems such as headaches, migraines, constipation, IBS, insomnia, tension and restless mind.</p><br><p> Tui na massage is great for addressing all types of chronic or acute pain such as:</p>

The practitioner will ask the patient a series of questions, then begin treatment based on the answers to those questions. It can be done over loose fitting clothing or on bare skin, and with therapeuticic oils. Tui na can be used as a stand  alone treatment or combined with other therapies.</p><br><p> There is no such thing as a full body Tuina massage in China. The Tuina doctor treats just the problem that the patient presents him with, very much like his Western counterpart does. The similarity goes even further. Just as drugs have side effects so does Tuina . . . . but here the similarity ends. Side effects resulting from the Chinese therapy are almost always good ones (except some mild aching or soreness after receiving a first Tuina session). The reason for this is that successful balancing of qi in one area of the body results in improved qi status throughout.</p><br><h4 style="color:#069">Tui Na practitioners employ a variety of methods to achieve their goal. Commonly used techniques include hand techniques to massage the soft tissue of the body, acupressure techniques to directly affect the flow of Qi, and manipulation techniques to realign the musculoskeletal and ligamentous relationships.  The major focus of application is upon specific pain sites, acupressure points, energy meridians, and muscles and joints.

The type of massage delivered by a Tui Na practitioner can be quite vigorous and tends to be more task-focused than other types of bodywork. The client usually feels relaxed but energized by the treatment. Some patients may experience feelings of sleepiness or euphoria.</h4>

If 24 hours is not given, the client will be responsible to pay a 50% charge of the scheduled appointment. If the booked appointment is missed with no contact a 100% charge will be applied. <br><br>Please be aware that when booking an appointment on the same day, it is considered set, and if changed, cancelled or rescheduled at any point after it is made, the client is responsible for paying for the full price of the appointment.<br><br>Cancellation fees are in effect to ensure that our therapists are compensated for their time. Please keep in mind that if inadequate notice is given it is extremely difficult to fill vacant spots, this not only negatively impacts our therapists who only get paid when they deliver a treatment, but also affects our clients. Please be courteous to your therapist and other clients by respecting our policies.
