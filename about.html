							<div class="about-desc">
								<h3>Johanna Catley</h3><h3>VTCT, ITEC (Dip), SNHS (Dip) MFHT </h3><p>I am a Certified Holistic Therapist and Skin care Specialist and I am a Professional Member Of The Federation of Holistic Therapists. Besides other qualifications I hold a S.N.H.S diploma as a member of the International College Of Holistic Medicine.

 

Holistic medicine is a form of healing that considers the whole person -- body, mind, spirit, and emotions -- in the quest for optimal health and wellness.<p/><br><p> Also as a member of the British Healing Association I am a great believer in self healing and mental rejuvenation, and believe that the reduction of stress and tension can only enhance the healing therapies and treatments provided to clients.<p/><br><p>I have been trained in a variety of modalities. These include: Neuromuscular Therapy, Trigger Point, Swedish, Deep Tissue, Myofascial Therapy, Energy Work, Advanced Massage, Reflexology, Pregnancy Massage, Tuina ( accupressure) Massage, holistic Therapies and Lymphatic Massage. I am also knowledgable in Kinesiology, Anatomy and Physiology, which is a great help in being an excellent massage therapist, and customizing massage sessions for each individual..</p><br>
								<p> As a Skincare Specialist working with clients I realised I prefered to use products with as many natural and cold pressed ingredients as possible, those that harness the pure power of plants to provide optimal nourishment and repair to the skin. I needed to know exactly what was going into a product, and the only way to know exactly was to make my own products for clients which led me to formulate and develope my own skin care brand that i often use in facials, which fully comply with all legislation governing the manufacture of cosmetics in the UK and Europe, through the process of being fully laboratory tested and certified. </p><br>

<p>Before becoming a professional skin care therapist I had already been formulating and developing natural skin care recipes for many years.I believe in combining Science with the best in Nature.  </p><br><p>I am most interested in sustainable facial skin-care practices with cumulative benefits rather than quick fixes with long-term cumulative damage. My goal is to bring life, vitality, and nutrients by way of increased circulation. I want to release any blockages in the muscles, skin, and fascia that are preventing optimal circulation and release tension that we don't need to carry with us. When we release tension and restore optimal circulation, deep lines can soften, skin becomes rosy and plump again, and worry and strain can melt from the face.<a href="fascia -facial-natural-face-lift.html" class="link1">&nbsp;&nbsp;read about:&nbsp; Myofascial facial release (Natural Face Lift)</a></p>

						<br><h3>CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>In order to minimize disruptions to our schedule, we require 24 hours notice to change, cancel and/or reschedule Therapy appointments. If 24 hours is not given, the client will be responsible to pay a 50% charge of the scheduled appointment. If the booked appointment is missed with no contact a 100% charge will be applied. <br><br>Please be aware that when booking an appointment on the same day, it is considered set, and if changed, cancelled or rescheduled at any point after it is made, the client is responsible for paying for the full price of the appointment.<br><br>Cancellation fees are in effect to ensure that our therapists are compensated for their time. Please keep in mind that if inadequate notice is given it is extremely difficult to fill vacant spots, this not only negatively impacts our therapists who only get paid when they deliver a treatment, but also affects our clients. Please be courteous to your therapist and other clients by respecting our policies.</div>
