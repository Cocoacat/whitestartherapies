					<h3>Quantum - Breath Healing Massage</h3>
							<p class="para"> Quantum-Touch is a mind-body healing modality that uses breathing exercises, body awareness and light touch to amplify and accelerate the body’s innate healing capabilities. At the core of this technique is the idea that in each of us is life-force energy. The Chinese call this chi, and those familiar with Yoga and meditation have probably heard it referred to as prana. When our life-force is low, we are susceptible to disease, illness, pain and emotional disturbances. Quantum-Touch revitalizes our life-force, raising our energy and directing healing to the source of our pain.

Quantum-Breath may be used as either a standalone therapy or combined with other Massage Therapy treatments.</p>

			 <br><br><h3>CANCELLATION POLICY</h3>In order to minimize disruptions to our schedule, we require 24 hours notice to change, cancel and/or reschedule Therapy appointments. If 24 hours is not given, the client will be responsible to pay a 50% charge of the scheduled appointment. If the booked appointment is missed with no contact a 100% charge will be applied. <br><br>Please be aware that when booking an appointment on the same day, it is considered set, and if changed, cancelled or rescheduled at any point after it is made, the client is responsible for paying for the full price of the appointment.<br><br>Cancellation fees are in effect to ensure that our therapists are compensated for their time. Please keep in mind that if inadequate notice is given it is extremely difficult to fill vacant spots, this not only negatively impacts our therapists who only get paid when they deliver a treatment, but also affects our clients. Please be courteous to your therapist and other clients by respecting our policies.</div></div>
